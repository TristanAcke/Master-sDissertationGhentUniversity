This repository contains the final files used in Tristan Acke's master's dissertaton research on a fully automated Compliance Checking (CC) system. The study focused on a methodology aimed at using Large Language Models (LLM), specifically GPT-4, within a framework that tested the conversion of text to RASE markup to SHACL shapes.

This master's dissertation explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate compliance checks of building regulations within the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. The research focuses on the current limitations of Automated Compliance Checking (ACC) systems, which heavily rely on manual efforts to encode legal requirements from textual documents into computable rules. By leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly LLMs, this thesis proposes a new framework that integrates AI techniques, visual representations and Semantic Web technologies. This framework aims to reduce manual labour, increase system transparency and improve interoperability in the sector. The research methodology involves developing an automated cycle of multiple steps that utilizes LLMs, 
specifically GPT-4, to convert regulatory texts into computable formats, validated through a proof of concept. The findings indicate that the proposed approach can significantly streamline the ACC process and offer a more efficient and less error-prone alternative to traditional methods, ultimately contributing to advancements towards BIM Level 3 in the AEC industry. 

Thus, in this repository the files are available that use GPT-4 with which the conversion of text to RASE formatting to SHACL forms has been tested.
